# The-ChatGPT-Process-Scheduler
This project involves developing a Python script using ChatGPT to implement and simulate 4 process scheduling algorithms: FIFO, Pre-emptive SJF, Round Robin, and Linux's CFS. The script will read process data from an input file, execute the scheduling algorithms, calculate turnaround, waiting, and response times, and output the results to a file.
